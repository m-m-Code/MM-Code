  # MM-Codee
  readme.md
  We will have a demo programme of this where we instil this system between two videos or two slides/parts to show how it will look inside a real course.

  No copy and pasting
  //https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/javascript/how-to-disable-text-selection-copy-cut-paste-and-right-click-on-a-web-page.html
  <input type="text" onselectstart="return false" onpaste="return false;" onCopy="return false" onCut="return false" onDrag="return false" onDrop="return false" autocomplete=off/>

  There will be a pop up that explains what code will be copied and pasted - it will be a light message. It will explain the code, the result it will print -
  and how many times they will need to copy paste it. A little message at the end saying how these are the key steps to becoming a master could be nice.
  The user will close the pop up and then will see the code at the top of the screen with a 'begin' button next to it.
  The user will see the code and then click the begin button when they're ready to start typing away.
  The user will type the codes until the final line such as from line 1 to 4 and then click 'done'. The system will say if they're all correct or 'there's -
  an error in your code, could you find it?'. This will then make their visual skills improve alongside their muscle memory, which will come in really handy -
  when looking for errors in codes during their professional careers.




  Settings-
  Course owner will be able to:
  Change the message written on the pop up.
  Change the code that is going to be copied.
  Change the amount of code repetition per exercise.
  (We will give advice on which section should have how much code from a student pov.)
  (We could possibly do these settings for them according to what they want. One-off or yearly service if they think they'll be changing/improving their course -
  )  

  testing

  console.log("Hello");
  setTimeout(() => {  console.log("World!"); }, 5000);
